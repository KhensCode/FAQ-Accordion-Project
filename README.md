# FAQ Accordion Project  

A simple FAQ accordion component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## Features  
- Clickable dropdown buttons to show/hide answers  
- Clean, responsive design  
- Smooth hover effects on buttons  
- Minimalist styling  

## How It Works  
- Each FAQ item has a question and a hidden answer (`display: none`).  
- When a user clicks the dropdown button (`â–¼`), the corresponding answer toggles between `display: none` and `display: block`.  
- The JavaScript dynamically handles all FAQ items without hardcoding each one.  

## Why I Built This  
I wanted to practice:  
- DOM manipulation with `querySelectorAll` and `forEach`  
- Responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** (semantic structure)  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, hover effects)  
- **JavaScript** (DOM traversal, event handling)  



## Possible Improvements  
- Add animations for smoother transitions  
- Make it collapsible (only one FAQ open at a time)  
- Store FAQ data in JSON for dynamic loading
